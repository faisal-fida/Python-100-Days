00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,550
All right, guys, it's time to put what you've learned to the test. Now in this project, we're going

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,220
to be doing a little bit of mail merging.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,630
So mail merging is where you take something like what

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:20,210
we have a list of names, for example, and we want to insert each of these names into a letter.

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,040
So instead of saying dear [name], you are invited to my birthday the Saturday, it should say dear

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,240
and then it would replace that with whatever is here.

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,710
Take a look at this example file.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,070
You can see that it replaced the name placeholder with the first name in the invited_names.txt

9
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:38,550
file.

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,930
Your objective is to write some python code to automate the process.

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,940
So what you're going to end up with is a bunch of letters, one for each of the names inside the invited_

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:58,590
names.txt and the letters are going to be named like this: letter_for_ and

13
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,120
then the name of the person.

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:07,770
And they're going to be saved in a txt format, which you can open either in Google Docs or in Microsoft

15
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,190
Word.

16
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,950
And it's basically ready for printing.

17
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,770
So I've made it a little bit harder for you by adding in a whole bunch of folders.

18
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,330
And each of these files are nested inside a bunch of folders.

19
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,230
So, for example, starting letter is inside letters, which is inside input.

20
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,500
And then the letters that you're going to generate are going to need to go into this folder called Ready

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,430
ToSend, which is inside output. And no cheating.

22
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,010
I don't want you moving around any of these files.

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:44,730
You're going to be using what you've learned about directories and file paths to do everything without

24
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,850
needing to drag and drop or move anything around manually.

25
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,340
I've got some starting files for you.

26
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,520
So the first thing I want you to do is to go to the course resources and download the zip file, which

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,140
will be your starting project code.

28
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,130
Once you open it within PyCharm, it's going to ask you to configure the interpreter. So you can either

29
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,230
go ahead and click on that pop-up, or if it disappears, then just click on the event log and then click

30
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,330
on Configure Python Interpreter and then select the latest interpreter that you have installed.

31
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,200
So in my case, it's 3.8, but by the time you're watching this, it'll probably be 

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,120
3.9 or even later.

33
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,290
And once that's done, then you can go ahead and have a look inside main.py.

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,030
So here I've got some instructions for you.

35
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,750
First, you're going to create a letter using the starting_letter.txt, which is right here

36
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:43,130
nested two folders deep, and then you're going to use each of the names inside invited_names.

37
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:52,320
txt to replace the part where it says name with the actual names that you see in invited_names.txt.

38
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,200
And then you're going to save each of those letters that you've generated inside the folder ReadyTo

39
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,620
Send.

40
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:05,250
And you can take a look at the example if you want to see what the final outcome looks like.

41
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,030
So it's going to be the name without any spaces afterwards, just a comma.

42
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,850
Now there's going to be a few things that will trip you up along the way.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,240
And I'm hoping that you're going to use your knowledge about how to get help from Google and Stack overflow,

44
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,690
as well as some of these hints that I've left in here for you.

45
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:32,520
So the hints take you to three pages of Python documentation, and they're chosen because the methods

46
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,200
that are featured in them will definitely help you in this project.

47
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,670
In fact, some of the things that you're going to try to do won't be possible unless you take a look

48
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,920
at each of these pages of documentation, read through it, and understand what the methods do.

49
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:53,490
Now, as always, with a lot of tutorials, it's impossible to teach you every single method.

50
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:58,800
And it would be really, really tedious if I just went through all of the methods that are available in Python

51
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,050
and showed them to you individually.

52
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:08,190
So instead, you have to work just as a pro developer does which is to find out information when you

53
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:14,940
need it and to quickly understand what's happening and how to use the information you found on the fly.

54
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,750
Don't worry if you haven't seen me use these methods before. You will get more practice by using

55
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:27,200
the documentation, figuring things out yourself, and implementing things that you haven't seen before.

56
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,490
Once you're ready, go ahead and take a look at each of these links, see what each of the methods I've

57
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,830
linked to does, and then go ahead and try to tackle this challenge.

58
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,100
So pause the video and I'll see you on the other side.
